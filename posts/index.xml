      <description>Introduction  A little background about myself. I have always been fond of creating websites, and having my own place or brand in the internet. I have developed front end UI and UX in the past using ReactJS, and Angular when they were just starting out. Most of my projects are kept in a private repository on Bitbucket, they are still there but at this point in time I have forgotten how to customize them (poor documentation on my part).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Kenywil Tiu, an aspiring blockchain developer with interest in learning innovative technologies. The intention of this blog is to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning, and will be learning. This will also act as a journal for proof of concept mini projects, or full blown projects that I will be developing.
 As of now I have professional experience being a DevOps Engineer for 5 years. I also have a good understanding, and have programmed simple applications using programming languages such as Javascript, and Python.</description>
